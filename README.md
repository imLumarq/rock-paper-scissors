The classical Rock Paper Scissors game that we all grew up with. If I'm being completely honest, I still play Rock Paper Scissors till this day aginst my friends before starting a game S.K.A.T.E. There is nothing more satisfying then smashing my friends with rocks, (metaphorically speaking of course) ha ha ha... got you with that one. But for just remember that you ever play Rock Paper Scissors against me just know that paper is weakness, don't tell anybody ;).
